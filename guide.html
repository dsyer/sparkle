<p><em>48 Helix Road</em></p>

<p><em>London</em></p>

<p><em>SW2 2JS</em></p>

<p><em>Tel: 0208 671 6879</em></p>

<p>Nearest Tube: Brixton (Victoria Line) – 15 mins walk down Brixton Hill.</p>

<p>Mainline station: Herne Hill – 15 walk across Brockwell Park (trains to City, Victoria &amp; South East).</p>

<p>Brixton is bus central – buses going pretty much everywhere.</p>

<p>Lots of engineering work on Underground and mainline railways – some lines or stations may be closed especially at weekends. Check online before you travel.</p>

<h2>Keys etc</h2>

<p>There is no burglar alarm.</p>

<p>2 keys for front door: Chubb key for lower lock. Yale key for upper lock</p>

<p>Please lock door using both keys when you go out. Don&rsquo;t double lock the upper Yale if anyone is in the house &ndash; even if they have a key they won&rsquo;t be able to unlock it from the inside.</p>

<p>The back door (kitchen out to garden) doesn’t open too well! Hold right hand door &amp; push left hand door!</p>

<h2>Parking</h2>

<p>We do not have a car – public transport is excellent in central London.</p>

<p>On street parking on Helix Road is by permit only. There are cash meters on some of the immediate surrounding streets, although it&rsquo;s pretty expensive. It is possible to park for free at any time by going a bit further up the hill &amp; trying the streets beyond Elm Park (2 mins walk).</p>

<p>Residents can buy visitor parking permits from the Lambeth Council office on Brixton Hill – there is a form to download from the Lambeth website &amp; you must take 2 proofs of address when you go to pick up the permits (we will buy some for you and you can reimburse us if you let us know in advance).</p>

<p>Parking is, however, free after 6:30pm &amp; before 8:00am and at weekends on Helix Road.</p>

<h2>Cats</h2>

<ul>
<li>Robin – black with orange collar (little white frond of fur under his chin)</li>
<li>Maurice – smaller sleek tabby with black collar</li>
</ul>


<p>Please feed them twice a day &ndash; a handful of dry food each in the morning &amp; evening and keep their water bowl topped up.</p>

<p>Cat food is kept in the wall cupboard above the Logitech player in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Friday evenings: special treat – give them a packet of wet food (1 between them) with the dry food! They also tend to bug you for milk treats at any time of day or night. Feel free to give them a small amount of milk occasionally.</p>

<p>Spare collars &amp; magnets (worn on collar, to activate cat flap) are in the drawer below the Logitech player in the kitchen.</p>

<p>We use a cat sitting service: Maggie or Alex or Lucy from <a href="http://www.sittingkitty.co.uk">Sitting Kitty</a> will come to feed them every morning on request if you are away. Telephone 020 8768 5333 (Maggie has a hearing problem so don&rsquo;t use the phone unless you have to), so better to use email sitting_kitty@hotmail.com. Just say you are staying at our place and ask if she can come and look after Maurice and Robin. We normally pay by bank transfer, but if it&rsquo;s more convenient you can just leave cash for her (£12.50 per day).</p>

<p>Try not to let the cats go out the front door because of the road, or into the cellar because they freak out and can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t get back out. Robin in particular does occasionally show up in the front street, so he knows how to get there and back, but we try not to encourage him.</p>

<p>They are allowed in to most rooms, but we keep the door closed in the spare bedroom all the time &amp; shut them out of the living room when we are not in there and the weather is wet.</p>

<p>Other cats like to come in &amp; create mayhem, so keep an eye on the back door if you have it open; don’t let any other guys in there.</p>

<h2>Heat &amp; Hot Water</h2>

<p>Hot water on demand (wait a bit longer the higher up the house you go).</p>

<p>If you want the heating on, turn up the wall thermostat outside the kitchen. It is programmed to be on 24x7 &amp; will click on if you turn up the thermostat.</p>

<p>There are thermostatic valves on all radiators (don&rsquo;t adjust them in any other way).</p>

<p>Shower in the 1st floor bathroom, bath upstairs in top floor bathroom.</p>

<p>The gas fire in the back sitting room is useful on cold nights. To switch it on open the grate cover at the bottom and find the knob on the right; push it in, and simultaneously turn it anticlockwise until it clicks and the gas ignites; then hold it in for 30 secs while the valve heats up; finally release the knob and turn it anticlockwise to open the valve (flames appear).</p>

<h2>Kitchen</h2>

<p>The cooker has a gas hob &amp; an electric oven.</p>

<p>Turn the knobs for the burners to the right &amp; press the ignition button to light the burners – you will hear a clicking noise until the burners light.</p>

<p>Oven has function &amp; temperature knobs – you need to adjust both to get the oven to work. There are grill &amp; fan options as well as regular heating/cooking.</p>

<p>Microwave is on the worktop over the washing machine.</p>

<p>Most pans are hanging on the rack above the cooker. Heavy frying pans are on the shelf unit to left of back door (under where the toaster sits on the counter), and there are some large casserole pans in the side cupboard by the door to the hallway. There are two roasting tins and a rack on top of the fridge.</p>

<p>Smaller kitchen tools, corkscrew, bottle opener etc. can be found in the cutlery draw below the worktop to the right of the cooker.</p>

<p>Crockery all over the place – open all the cupboard doors until you find what you want!</p>

<p>Coffee grinder is on the worktop by the kettle; there is a white china drip filter &amp; filter papers are in the basket below the worktop. Large vacuum flask to drip coffee into is on the worktop. There is also a stove top Italian espresso coffee maker on the shelf above the kettle (Note: this coffee pot is NOT dishwasher safe).</p>

<p>We have a cleaner, Olga. She will come once a week whilst we are away (Thursdays) She usually comes around 1pm &amp; stays a couple of hours. Please leave out £20.00 in cash in an envelope on the kitchen table to pay her.</p>

<h3>Dishwasher &amp; cleaning stuff</h3>

<p>Dishwasher tablets, rinse aid, dishwasher salt, laundry soap &amp; other cleaning products in cupboard under sink.</p>

<p>Most things in the kitchen are dishwasher safe. Exceptions are generally things that are made of more than one part because the water gets in the gaps and damages them (bone-handle knives, coffee flask), and the odd thing that is not waterproof (e.g. an earthenware, half-glazed bowl that we use for bread). Use your head and if in doubt wash it by hand.</p>

<h2>Towels &amp; Bedding</h2>

<p>Supplies can be found in the cupboard upstairs in the top bathroom.</p>

<h2>Computers and Network</h2>

<p>There is WiFi (SSID=”48 Helix Road”, password=”spr1ngt1me”) but the signal can be erratic. If you have problems, try using the yellow network cable in the front sitting room. The large black laptop in the sitting room and the desktop PC in the study have guest accounts (user = “guest”, password=”password”). The black laptop has a noisy fan, so if you want to shut it up the easiest thing is to find the menu bar item that looks like an on/off switch and select “Suspend” (it wakes up quickly without losing your desktop when you open the lid again).</p>

<p>Please do not switch anything off in the front room or back of study (sockets at the front are safe but note that the wifi is boosted from that grey home plug at the back so that needs to be on). Soft power down and restart is an option if you know what you are doing.</p>

<h2>Music, TV/DVD &amp; Radios</h2>

<p>We use the Logitech players in the kitchen, sitting room, study and top bedroom for most of our audio needs. You can play music from our collection, and also radio or music streamed from the Internet. Practically any radio station you like can be streamed if you can find the right URL. We have favourites set up for the ones we listen to.  We also use Napster as a streaming service and the system is signed in with our account credentials (subscription is paid for so listen to as much as you want).</p>

<p>The players are driven from a Squeezebox server that lives in the small computer on the table in the front room. It has to be switched on and connected to the network all the time &ndash; do not switch it off. You can control the whole system from a web browser through the Squeezebox server, visible from the local network as <a href="http://192.168.1.113:9000">http://192.168.1.113:9000</a>. If you have a smart phone, you can also control the players from an app on the phone (iPeng is the best). The Touch units in the kitchen and study also have remote control handheld widgets. The player in the front room actually is only controllable from a browser or smart phone.</p>

<p>Napster shows up as an app link in the server. Feel free to use it as much as you want, but don&rsquo;t leave it on over night or if you go out because you will hit the bandwidth limit for the ISP.</p>

<p>There are standalone analogue or digital radios in many rooms as well.</p>

<p>There is a CD player in the sitting room and the spare bedroom but all the CDs have been ripped to the Logitech system. They are still there physically if you like to do it that way, and you can use it to play your own CDs, or an iPod if you have one (there is a white iPod cable attached to the stereo in the front room).</p>

<p>There is only one TV/DVD recorder/player – in the rear sitting room. The TV works on its own with the long, slim remote labelled &ldquo;TV&rdquo;. That remote and also the other Sony one, which operates the DVD/BD player can be used to switch the input source (look for a button with a &lsquo;&ndash;>&rsquo; arrow) &ndash; the DVD is on AV4 and the Humax video recorder is on AV1. You can also plug a PC in and use the monitor and headphone cables that dangle off the back of the TV to hook it up to watch from the Internet.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Audio and Network Issues</h3>

<p>The Logitech players work really well most of the time.  Unfortunately they only work if the network is fully functional, and even when it is, the players sometimes lose their connection and go quiet. There is a decent community supporting the system, so the first port of call if anything goes wrong with the audio system is the <a href="http://forums.slimdevices.com/">slim devices forum</a>. For some reason the network is always more likely to be dodgy on Thursdays (coincidentally, Olga the cleaner comes on Thursdays, but we have no idea what the link is).</p>

<p>Here are some things to try that have worked for us at times:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if a player says it is buffering or syncing, give it some time to finish.</p></li>
<li><p>If a player is not playing, switch it off and back on again.  With the Touch units you can use the remote control, or a web browser via the Squeezebox server. With the player in the front room, try the smart phone app and the browser, and if that fails pull the power cord out of the back of the unit and plug it back in.</p></li>
<li><p>The player in the front room has a status light. Red or yellow is bad, and probably requires a power cycle. Blue or White is good.</p></li>
<li><p>If nothing seems to work, it sometimes helps to de-synchronise the players. They are set to play the same tracks simultaneously by default, although you may notice up to a minute drift. If you unsync them using the web browser or smart phone app they usually play more reliably. In the browser look at the &ldquo;players&rdquo; drop downs at the top right of the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>With a computer, even if the wireless network is completely AWOL, you can usually get connected using a wired or home plug connection. The is a long yellow cable under the table in the front room, and a home plugged blue cable on each of the desks in the study.</p></li>
<li><p>Check all the Ethernet cables in the back of both boxes under the table in the front room are firmly in their sockets (there&rsquo;s a Netgear router down there and a wires repeater that provides the wireless signal in the front room).</p></li>
<li><p>The wireless signal in the kitchen and upstairs comes from the home plug unit in the socket nearest the door in the study. It is always safe and sometimes helps to just unplug that and plug it back in.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the router or other vital stuff under the table in the front room get accidentally unplugged. Check all the stuff under there.</p></li>
<li><p>As a last resort you might sometimes need to reboot the router (we end up doing this maybe twice a year). The best way to do that is via software signals sent to the router. Go to <a href="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</a> and login as <em>admin</em> with password &ldquo;password&rdquo;. Look for the menu on the left called &ldquo;Network Diagnostics&rdquo;, click on that and then follow the link to &ldquo;reboot router&rdquo;. It usually takes a few minutes to come back.</p></li>
<li><p>Please do <strong>not</strong> switch off or unplug random things under the table in the front room &ndash; the Squeezebox server that streams all the audio, in particular is very sensitive to being ungracefully shutdown. If you know what you are doing you can log into it as root with password &ldquo;root&rdquo;, but please don&rsquo;t meddle with it if you aren&rsquo;t an exper</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Bicycles</h2>

<p>There are 2 road bikes hanging up in the outhouse just outside the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Helmets are also in the outhouse, or maybe in the hall at the top of the cellar steps.  Locks &amp; bike tools, paniers etc. are in the basket below the coat hooks by the cellar door, or in the kitchen drawers.</p>
